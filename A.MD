## Angular Interview Questions

### Core Concepts
1. **What is Angular Framework?**  
   Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source framework for building dynamic web apps. It uses components, dependency injection, and a modular architecture.

2. **Difference between AngularJS and Angular?**  
   AngularJS (1.x) uses JavaScript and MVC architecture, while Angular (2+) uses TypeScript, components, and a hierarchical dependency injection system.

3. **What is Data Binding?**  
   - **One-way**: `{{value}}` or `[property]="value"`  
   - **Two-way**: `[(ngModel)]="property"`

### Components & Directives
4. **What is a Component?**  
   A reusable UI building block with a template, class (logic), and metadata (decorator).

5. **Difference between Structural and Attribute Directives**  
   - **Structural**: Modify DOM layout (e.g., `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`).  
   - **Attribute**: Change element behavior/appearance (e.g., `ngClass`, `ngStyle`).

### Services & Dependency Injection
6. **What is a Service?**  
   A singleton class for sharing data/logic across components. Injected via DI:
   ```typescript
   @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
   export class DataService { ... }
What is Dependency Injection?
A design pattern where dependencies are provided to a class rather than created within it.

Java Interview Questions
Core Java
Difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM

JDK: Development kit (compiler + tools).

JRE: Runtime environment (JVM + libraries).

JVM: Executes bytecode.

OOP Concepts

Encapsulation: Hide data via private fields and public methods.

Inheritance: extends keyword.

Polymorphism: Method overriding/overloading.

Abstraction: Abstract classes/interfaces.

final vs finally vs finalize

final: Immutable variable/class/method.

finally: Code block in try-catch (always executes).

finalize(): Method called by garbage collector before object destruction.

Collections & Multithreading
Difference between ArrayList and LinkedList

ArrayList: Dynamic array (fast read, slow insert/delete).

LinkedList: Doubly linked list (slow read, fast insert/delete).

What is the synchronized keyword?
Ensures only one thread accesses a method/block at a time.

Advanced Topics
Explain JVM Architecture

Class Loader: Loads classes.

Runtime Data Areas: Heap, stack, method area.

Execution Engine: Interprets bytecode.
